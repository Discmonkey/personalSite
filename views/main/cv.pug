	h4 About Me
	p I am a web engineer, physicist, mathematician, and occasional chef with a strong aptitude for creative solutions. I enjoy crafting simple and hopefully powerful user interfaces and web pages. I am always trying to learn new technologies, and perfect my own code. I find programming beautiful in much the same way as a concise math theorem, physics postulate, or a cleanly worded passage.
